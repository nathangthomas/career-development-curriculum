# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.* 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?


	Solidify concepts we have already been introduced to as well as practicing working as a pair on a project. Taking steps toward proficiency in writing Ruby code.  
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

	Navigator/driver. Our preference at this time is to work as a pair opposed to a divide-and-conquer approach. We like the idea of having two people to work on the problems together at the same time instead of working solo and merging them at the end. 
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

	Timely, relevant, and often... with compassion. 
* How would you describe your work style?

	Get personal commitments out of the way beforehand so that we can focus on our code for longer sprints at a time. 

* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

	Nathan: I tend to be persistant about the projects I am working on. If I hit a problem it is unlikely to discourage me from continuing push forward on a project. I may need reminders to take breaks. I have high interpersonal effectiveness skills so will do well with helping to create an environment that is less likely to have tension. I also take feedback well.
	
	Sejin: Very similar strengths to Nathan. Also very optimistic, will see a positive output from every situation. Very playful as well so will keep things fun, hopefully not falling down the rabbit hole.
	
	
	
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
* How will we overcome obstacles?
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
